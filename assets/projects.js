    "description": "Blackjack Multiplayer Online is an online multiplayer casino game. It's similar to the traditional blackjack played at real casinos. You can choose to play alone or play in a private room with your friends. The goal of the game is to beat the dealer and win as much money as possible.\nI built this game using pure JavaScript and Sass for the frontend. For the backend I used Express.js as well as WebSockets for real time communication.",
